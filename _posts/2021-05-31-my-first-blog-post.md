# WHY I STARTED MY TECH JOURNEY
## Introduction
Most people(For most people),their journeys in tech begin with a genuine interest/curiosity about   computers or just tech in general.That was not the case for me,i honestly do not recall a time where i  had any interest whatsoever in tech.
Even though i was a user,i just never wanted to know what the other side of tech was like.So how does a person like me end up learning how to code and actually loving it?That is what todays article is all about

## Life before Tech
The year was 2016 and i had just graduated from Ardhi University in Tanzania where i majored in Real Estate.Like most graduates  i came out of college with high hopes of getting employed,little did i know that reality was about to hit me full force.

I applied for several jobs did interviews ,unfortunately i did not land a job at all.I remember sitting at home thinking to myself that  i am ready for any job.I  tried doing business baking and selling cakes but that did not go so well. I finaly gave up and just stayed at home...it was during that time that  i stumbled into tech


## The How……
My journey began on Youtube,i watched alot of youtube videos back then and i  remember watching a video  that featured promintent figures in tech like Bill Gates,Mark zuk  and in this particular they were talling about the benefits of learning how to code  and why people should learn how to code.
That was when i began my research on how i can learn how to code and  that is how i began learining  at freecode camp.
